# Minesweeper

Contains a completed minesweeper game, including a welcome window and leaderboard window, built with sfml graphics in C++. The game can be paused, restarted, or quit at any point during the game using the buttons at the bottom of the game window. For the leaderboard window to function, the game reads and writes to a txt file called "leaderboaard.txt" which stores the top 5 times the game has been won in. Pausing the game results in each tile being covered so as to prevent cheating, as does opening the leaderboard. To flag mines, right click on the tile you wish to flag. The mine counter in the bottom left portion of the screen indicates how many mines remain based on how many flags you have placed; this number can become negative (meaning a mistake has been made).
